# Genetic Algorithm-Based Budget Optimization :
- The goal of this project is to help individuals optimize their personal budgets by developing a genetic algorithm. Precisely, this project will use a set of budget categories (such as food & drinks, life & entertainment, education, vehicle, shopping, and housing) and a fixed budget amount that represents monthly wages. The algorithm should generate an optimal allocation of funds across these categories. The algorithm will determine which is the best amount of money that we can spend for each category. The results of this project can be used in personal finances for decision-making and improve financial well-being.


## The objective of this project is to : 
- To apply Genetic Algorithm for optimization in budget expenses .
- To help people allocate the best amount of money for each category of commitment .  
- To justify the best fitness solution for the optimization .

## Software and Packages
- python
- Jupyter Lab
